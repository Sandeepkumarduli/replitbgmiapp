# RD TOURNAMENTS HUB: Migration to Supabase

## Status of Migration

We've successfully modified the application to use Supabase exclusively and removed OTP/email verification as requested. Here's the current status of our migration:

✓ Removed OTP/email verification from authentication
✓ Implemented hardcoded admin credentials (Sandeepkumarduli/Sandy@1234)
✓ Updated SupabaseStorage class with all required methods
✓ Modified db.ts to exclusively use Supabase
✓ Removed Neon DB references from the codebase
✓ Created SQL scripts for setting up Supabase tables

## Remaining Tasks

There are a few remaining tasks to complete the migration:

1. **Create the Tables in Supabase**: You'll need to execute the SQL script in the Supabase dashboard SQL Editor
2. **Verify Admin Credentials**: Test logging in with the admin user credentials
3. **Verify Data Operations**: Test creating teams, tournaments, and other functionality

## How to Complete the Setup

### Step 1: Create Supabase Tables

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to the SQL Editor
4. Copy the contents of `sql_migrations/create_all_tables.sql` 
5. Paste it into a new query in the SQL Editor
6. Run the query to create all tables

For detailed instructions, refer to the `docs/SUPABASE_DATABASE_SETUP.md` guide.

### Step 2: Verify Your Environment Variables

Make sure your Supabase environment variables are set correctly:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Step 3: Restart the Application

After setting up your tables, restart the application to see the changes take effect.

### Step 4: Test Admin Login

The hardcoded admin credentials have been implemented:
- Username: Sandeepkumarduli
- Password: Sandy@1234

Test these credentials to make sure the login works properly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Supabase connection:

1. **Check if tables were created successfully** in the Supabase Table Editor
2. **Verify environment variables** are correct
3. **Check the repair admin endpoint**: Visit `/api/diagnostic/repair-admin` in development mode to ensure the admin user is created correctly
4. **Check application logs** for any error messages related to Supabase
5. **Use SQL Editor console** in Supabase to verify data

## Important Notes

1. **OTP/Email Verification**: We've completely removed OTP and email verification as requested.
2. **Admin Credentials**: These are hardcoded for the first login as Sandeepkumarduli/Sandy@1234.
3. **Database Choice**: The application is now configured to use Supabase exclusively, avoiding all Neon DB references.
4. **Row Level Security**: Basic RLS policies are provided but may need customization for your specific security needs.

## Next Steps

After completing the migration, you may want to:

1. **Add sample data** for testing
2. **Customize the UI** if needed
3. **Enhance security** with additional RLS policies
4. **Set up production environments** with proper secrets management
